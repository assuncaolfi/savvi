savvi is a package for Safe Anytime Valid Inference. Also, it’s a savvy
pun.

From Ramdas et al. ([2023](#ref-ramdas2023gametheoretic)):

> Safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) provides measures of statistical
> evidence and certainty – e-processes for testing and confidence
> sequences for estimation – that remain valid at all stopping times,
> accommodating continuous monitoring and analysis of accumulating data
> and optional stopping or continuation for any reason.
