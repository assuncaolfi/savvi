savvi is a package for Safe Anytime Valid Inference. Also, it's a savvy pun.

From @ramdas2023gametheoretic:

> Safe anytime-valid inference (SAVI) provides measures of statistical evidence
> and certainty -- e-processes for testing and confidence sequences for estimation
> -- that remain valid at all stopping times, accommodating continuous monitoring
> and analysis of accumulating data and optional stopping or continuation for
> any reason.
