savvi is a package for Safe Anytime Valid Inference (SAVI). Also, it's a savvy
pun.

The goal of this package is to provide methods to calculate confidence intervals
and p-values that are valid at all sample sizes. 

More formally, given a significance level $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, a $(1 - \alpha)$
confidence sequence for parameters $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is a sequence of
intervals $C_n$ such that

$$P(\forall n \geq 1 : \theta \notin C_n) \leq \alpha.$$

$p_n$ is an anytime-valid p-value for that process if

$$P(\forall n \geq 1 : p_n \leq \alpha) \leq \alpha.$$
